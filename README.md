‚ö°Code-Assist - AI-Assisted Code Editor with Real-Time Collaboration
üéì Final Year Project Overview
Code-Assistt (previously called SynapseCode) is my final year B.Tech project, developed to address the growing needs of modern software development teams. It is an AI-assisted, real-time collaborative code editor that combines powerful coding features with intelligent automation. The project emphasizes teamwork, productivity, and intuitive design‚Äîperfect for remote collaboration, coding interviews, and team projects.
